	// Standard response for successful HTTP requests.

	// The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action.

	const BAD_GATEWAY = 502;

	// The server cannot handle the request (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance). Generally, this is a temporary state
